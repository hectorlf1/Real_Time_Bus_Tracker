Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: This project gets the location from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) for the buses in the city of Boston near the MIT and Harvard Universities and displays it asynchronously in a map layer. Further improvements include some style modifications to make the markers and popups from Mapbox look more elegant.
 
How to run: After the HTML is loaded, the app needs to be initiated through the "Start tracking Boston buses" button, and then the locations can refresh it manually via the "Refresh" button. 

Roadmap of future improvements: some future enhancements include,
A) More elegant markers and popups for the buses icons and tags, including a custom icon of a bus to be used as markers.
B) An auto update box to be included in the UI so that the users can set a refreshing time and have the app automatically refresh the location as often as specified.
C) Add functionality to track the position of the buses and draw a line from where the buses have been to their current geolocations.
